# NVIDIA cuVS dense search backend

The `cuvs` backend keeps OpenViking's embedded record store, scalar indexes, sparse retrieval, and recovery logic, while executing dense vector search with NVIDIA cuVS. cuVS 26.06 Python wheels require Python 3.11 or newer.

Install the package matching the host CUDA major version:

```bash
# CUDA 12
pip install -e .
pip install cuvs-cu12 'cupy-cuda12x[ctk]' --extra-index-url=https://pypi.nvidia.com

# CUDA 13
pip install -e .
pip install cuvs-cu13 'cupy-cuda13x[ctk]' --extra-index-url=https://pypi.nvidia.com
```

Start with exact brute-force search:

```json
{
  "storage": {
    "workspace": "/data/openviking",
    "vectordb": {
      "backend": "cuvs",
      "distance_metric": "cosine",
      "cuvs": {
        "algorithm": "brute_force",
        "dtype": "float32",
        "max_concurrent_gpu_searches": 1,
        "micro_batching_enabled": false,
        "fallback_to_native": true,
        "filter_cache_size": 16
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Set `algorithm` to `cagra` for approximate graph search. `build_params` and `search_params` are passed to cuVS `cagra.IndexParams` and `cagra.SearchParams` respectively.

### Memory-aware auto mode

Keep `backend` set to `local` and enable `cuvs.auto_enable` to use otherwise
idle GPU memory without changing the default behavior for other installations:

```json
{
  "storage": {
    "vectordb": {
      "backend": "local",
      "cuvs": {
        "auto_enable": true,
        "algorithm": "brute_force",
        "auto_memory_reserve_mb": 1024,
        "auto_memory_safety_factor": 2.0,
        "auto_filter_native_threshold": 2000,
        "auto_path_filter_native_threshold": 200,
        "auto_background_rebuild": true,
        "auto_rebuild_debounce_ms": 500
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Before each lazy build or rebuild, auto mode reads free device memory and
estimates the device vector payload for the configured `dtype`, the CAGRA graph
and intermediate graph when applicable, and the configured filter-bitset
cache. It multiplies those known allocations by
`auto_memory_safety_factor` and then preserves `auto_memory_reserve_mb`. If the
estimate does not fit, or cuVS/GPU discovery
is unavailable, that query uses the unchanged native index. The cuVS index
remains dirty so a later query can retry after GPU memory becomes available.
An allocation failure after admission also falls back to native. Explicit
`backend: "cuvs"` retains fail-fast behavior and does not use this gate.
Build and admission are coordinated per GPU across local collections, so two
concurrent builds cannot both pass the same stale free-memory observation.
Builds on different devices remain independent; warmed searches are not
serialized by this coordinator.
Auto mode also uses the eligible count returned by the native scalar index for
latency-aware filtered-query routing. Filters with at most
`auto_filter_native_threshold` candidates use native vector recall; path
filters use the lower `auto_path_filter_native_threshold` because URI Trie and
bitmap construction can dominate wider subtrees. The defaults are 2,000 and
200 candidates respectively, and either value can be set to zero to disable
that route. These crossover values are hardware- and workload-dependent.
Explicit `backend: "cuvs"` continues to use cuVS for supported dense queries.

`auto_background_rebuild` is disabled by default. When enabled, consecutive
mutations are coalesced for `auto_rebuild_debounce_ms`, and a worker builds the
new immutable GPU snapshot without holding the cross-backend mutation lock.
The 500 ms default avoids rebuilding most intermediate batches during normal
interactive ingestion. For a known multi-call bulk load, wrap all writes in
`async with backend.bulk_ingest(ctx=ctx):`: native visibility and persistence
still advance per call, while derived GPU maintenance is deferred until the
outermost scope exits and then scheduled once. This scope is a maintenance hint,
not a transaction or atomicity boundary; exiting it schedules the rebuild but
does not itself wait for GPU readiness. The vector backend benchmark adds that
explicit readiness wait before timing search. Changing the debounce remains
useful for callers that cannot identify a bulk-load boundary. Auto remains
opt-in; with Auto/background rebuild disabled, the scope is a no-op for derived
maintenance and native CPU behavior and dtype are unchanged.
Queries use the current native index while the snapshot is dirty, so GPU build
time does not become request queue time. The worker installs the new label
layout and GPU snapshot atomically only if its record generation is still
current; otherwise it discards that build and rebuilds the newest generation.

## GPU memory footprint

With the default `dtype: "float32"`, brute-force's dominant retained device
payload is `N * dimension * 4` bytes. Opt-in `dtype: "float16"` reduces that
device payload to `N * dimension * 2` bytes. CAGRA additionally retains approximately
`N * graph_degree * 4` bytes for the graph and can require an intermediate
`N * intermediate_graph_degree * 4` bytes while building. Each cached filter
bitset costs approximately `ceil(N / 32) * 4` bytes.

Prior index-only runs measured the following `cudaMemGetInfo` deltas from just
before to just after build; each value is the median of five clean processes:

| Dataset | cuVS algorithm | Measured GPU delta |
| --- | --- | ---: |
| 100K x 768D | brute-force | 294 MiB |
| 1M x 768D | brute-force | 2.9 GiB |
| 100K x 1024D | brute-force | 392 MiB |
| 1M x 1024D | brute-force | 3.9 GiB |
| 1,183,514 x 100D | brute-force | 452 MiB |
| 1,183,514 x 100D | CAGRA | 872 MiB |

These are retained-build deltas rather than sampled peak VRAM. Allocator
state, cuVS version, CAGRA parameters, query batch size, and concurrent GPU
workloads can increase the peak. The delta also excludes the approximately
327 MiB CUDA runtime/context baseline observed before build in these processes.
This is why auto mode initializes the runtime first, reads the remaining free
memory, and then applies a conservative safety factor and independent reserve
rather than admitting from the vector payload alone.

## Data type and native-index behavior

Enabling cuVS does not change OpenViking's default backend or rewrite the
native CPU index. The normal collection metadata remains
`VectorIndex.Quant=int8`, so native fallback searches keep the existing
per-vector-scale int8 quantization. In parallel, the cuVS device dataset and
queries use the configured `dtype`: float32 by default, or float16 when
explicitly selected. The host record shadow retains prepared Python
floating-point values; only the device dataset and queries are cast to the
configured dtype when each is created. The cuVS Python brute-force API accepts
those two device representations rather than OpenViking's scaled int8 record
format.

The two dense paths therefore do not have equal memory or numerical semantics:
native results are exact within the quantized CPU representation, while cuVS
brute-force is exact over its retained float32 or float16 device
representation. Small score or neighbor ordering differences are expected.
Benchmarks must report the two data types and include Recall@K instead of
presenting the comparison as equal-dtype or equal-memory. This separation is
intentional for the initial opt-in
integration and leaves existing CPU behavior unchanged. In auto mode, the
filter candidate thresholds can select either representation per query, so
applications that require one fixed numerical representation should use an
explicit backend or disable the native-routing thresholds.

Lower-precision GPU storage is explicit rather than an implicit cast. Setting
`dtype: "float16"` casts both the cuVS dataset and every query to float16 for
brute-force or CAGRA; mixed query/index dtypes are not used. This is a storage
cast, not per-vector quantization, and must be reported with Recall@K against
the default float32 path. Native-compatible int8 still requires a separate
design because OpenViking uses a per-vector scale that cuVS brute-force does
not accept directly. CAGRA int8 or PQ compression must likewise be evaluated
as approximate modes with an explicit recall/latency/memory frontier.

The integration uses immutable GPU snapshots. Warmed searches use per-thread
cuVS resources/CUDA streams, while mutation and snapshot commit use a
cross-backend writer lock. Host-side filter and snapshot work can proceed in
parallel, but `max_concurrent_gpu_searches` defaults to 1 because concurrent
single-query brute-force kernels can contend for memory bandwidth and reduce
throughput. Increase it only after measuring the target GPU and workload. By
default, the first query after an upsert or delete rebuilds synchronously;
optional background rebuild changes dirty queries to native fallback until the
new snapshot is ready. On each rebuild it registers the cuVS label order with
the native engine once.
The first use of a scalar or URI filter then reuses OpenViking's native
scalar/path index and projects its bitmap into cuVS row order; it does not scan
all host-side records in Python. `filter_cache_size` retains the resulting
device bitsets and routing decisions and invalidates them on mutation. In auto
mode, candidate-count preflight runs before the cuVS search path.
Different unseen filters can use the native engine's shared-read path in
parallel, while cached native routing decisions go directly to the native
index. A record-generation check prevents a result computed across a mutation
from entering the route cache.

### Opt-in request micro-batching

Exact brute-force search can coalesce compatible concurrent requests into one
cuVS matrix-query call:

```json
{
  "storage": {
    "vectordb": {
      "backend": "cuvs",
      "cuvs": {
        "algorithm": "brute_force",
        "max_concurrent_gpu_searches": 1,
        "micro_batching_enabled": true,
        "micro_batching_max_batch_size": 8,
        "micro_batching_max_wait_ms": 1.0
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The scheduler batches only requests using the same immutable GPU snapshot,
prepared filter, and effective top-k. Each result row is mapped back to its
original request, so scalar/path filtering and result limits retain their
existing semantics. The collection window is a latency-throughput tradeoff:
under low concurrency a singleton query can wait up to the configured window;
under sufficient concurrency up to eight queries share one GPU call.
GPU-resident rebuild and device-filter preparation remain serialized by the
same search-admission gate before enqueue. The caller releases that gate before
waiting for its batch result, so batching cannot deadlock the worker.

This OpenViking micro-batcher is disabled by default and is distinct from the
cuVS feature named Dynamic Batching. Its first version supports
`algorithm: "brute_force"` with `max_concurrent_gpu_searches: 1`; CAGRA and
multiple concurrent batch dispatches are rejected until separately validated.
Auto mode can use the same options, but requests routed to the native CPU path
never enter the GPU batch queue. Near-tie neighbor ordering may differ between
single-row and matrix-query calls; validate set overlap and scores when tuning
for a workload.

Sparse/hybrid queries fall back to OpenViking's native local index when
`fallback_to_native` is enabled. The canonical vectors remain in the local
store and repopulate cuVS after restart.

The `[ctk]` CuPy extra installs the CUDA toolkit headers required by the cuVS
Python interop path, even when the host provides a CUDA driver but no toolkit.

After installation, run `python examples/cuvs_smoke.py` for an exact
GPU-backed write and filtered-search check, or
`python examples/cuvs_smoke.py --algorithm cagra` to exercise the graph index.
Add `--dtype float16` to either command to validate the lower-precision path.
Neither command requires an embedding or VLM service.
